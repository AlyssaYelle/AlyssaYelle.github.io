to do things you know you know you know you are
sisters who never

is never about war story
about war story

write back and march into the end
who never about war story is never about war story
dawn
mountains
march into the end of course
memory it’s about war story
know you know

say it until i am the house and
into a revolver with
good enough in every chamber so i am the house
the house and the house and the
