        <h2>Who is she??</h2>
        <p>
      		Hey! I'm Alyssa & I'm a software engineer based in Brooklyn.<br>
      		I design things. I build things. I love dogs.
      	</p>

        <h2>What's her story??</h2>
        <p>
          Many moons ago, I played french horn professionally.
          Not quite as many moons ago, I worked at the UT Austin Institute for Geophysics as a lab tech.
          I analyzed Antarctic radar data and got to see some cool stuff like subglacial lakes and even some evidence of subglacial volcanoes.
          Cool, right? I thought so too, and wanted to use machine learning to detect all the subglacial water, so I did a proof of concept project on automatic detection of subglacial water.
          My work on automation introduced me to the fascinating world of using code to build cool and helpful things, and now here I am!

        <h2>Why should I hire her??</h2>
        <p>
          I like to bring creativity and curiosity to everything I do, and I think that makes me a pretty great software engineer. I'm sure you'd like some evidence of that, so here's a list of some of my achievements:
            <ul>
              <li>I was one of 25 students selected (out of 1200!) to participate in the American Express Developer Academy.</li>
              <li>I was admitted into UT Austin's Intellectual Entrepeneurship Program, where I spent a semester doing data science research under the guidance of Wesley Tansey and James Scott. I then presented my research at the Joint Statistical Meetings and Mathfest!</li>
              <li>I've played at Carnegie Hall!</li>
              <li>I invented one of Houndstooth Coffee's signature drinks, the Lime Iron.</li>
              <li>Animals love me! I've been featured in Best Friends Animal Society's volunteer spotlight.</li>
            </ul>
