Hi friends! It hit me recently that I somehow managed to get a stats degree without ever doing regression. That seemed... *off*, so I read up on it and now I want to write about it in case there are any other budding data scientists in the same position I was. I'm going to break this tutorial up into two parts: math, because math is great and understanding how to derive regression will make the coding 800x easier, and programming, because let's be real, no one wants to do regression by hand.

Before I get into the technical stuff, I just want to give a general overview of linear regression.
